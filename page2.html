        <p1= center> My favorite TV Show:</p1>

        <br>
        The Sopranos

        This show did such a great job of making complex characters that are horrible people on the surface but also giving them so much depth that they actually become likable.
        Also the writing is so hilarious that you cant help but love it
        I cant really link any clips to the show because its very mature but I will link the intro to the show which is pretty iconic.
